I have exciting news to share about GitHub Codespace integration, GitHub Sponsoring, Rust binding, SquareLine release and voting. 


## GitHub Codespace integration
Now you can try out LVGL with just 3 clicks in a user-friendly online VS Code editor powered by GitHub Codespaces:

1. Go to lvgl's GitHub repository
2. Follow the steps on the image below
3. Wait a minute while the Codespace builds up
4. Type ./build_all.sh in the Terminal
5. Wait an other minutes while LVGL compiles
 
and enjoy the result right in VS Code.

With the default 4 CPU core setup you can use it for free for 30 hours per month.

## GitHub Sponsors
We have migrated to [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/lvgl) to manage the development and sponsorship in a common place. And we already have our first large sponsor: Espressif just started supporting LVGL with a monthly sponsorship.  It helps a lot for us to bring stability to LVGL. 
 
## Rust binding updates
[lvgl-rs](https://github.com/rafaelcaricio/lvgl-rs/), an unofficial Rust binding for LVGL, just got a [new maintainer](https://forum.lvgl.io/t/rust-bindings-for-lvgl-updated/11406). Now it supports all the major LVGL features so if you like Rust, give it try!
 
## SquareLine Studio release
We have released SquareLine Studio v1.2.3 with a couple of minor features and bug fixes. You can check out the [Announcement](https://forum.squareline.io/t/v1-2-3-is-released/1076 ) here. 
 
## Voting on squareline.io
If you visit [http://squareline.io/](https://squareline.io/) a popup will appear where you can tell us which MCU/MPU manufacturer do you prefer the most. It takes only 20 seconds to vote, but it helps a lot for us to decide on what to focus the most.
