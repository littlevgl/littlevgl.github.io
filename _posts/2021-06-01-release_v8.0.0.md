**v8.0 brings many new features like simplified and more powerful scrolling, new layouts inspired by CSS Flexbox and Grid, simplified and improved widgets, more powerful events, hookable drawing, and more.**

v8 is a major change and therefore it's not backward compatible with v7. 

### Directory structure
- The `lv_` prefix is removed from the folder names
- The `docs` is moved to the `lvgl` repository
- The `examples` are moved to the `lvgl` repository
- Create an `src/extra` folder for complex widgets:
   - It makes the core LVGL leaner
   - In `extra` we can have a lot and specific widgets
   - Good place for contributions

### Widget changes
- `lv_cont` removed, layout features are moved to `lv_obj`
- `lv_page` removed, scroll features are moved to `lv_obj`
- `lv_objmask` the same can be achieved by events
- `lv_meter` added as the unioin of `lv_linemeter` and `lv_gauge`
- `lv_span` new widget mimicing HTML `<span>`
- `lv_animing` new widget for simple slideshow animations
- \+ many minor changes and improvements

### New scrolling
- Support "elastic" scrolling when scrolled in
- Support scroll chaining among any objects types (not only `lv_pages`s)
- Remove `lv_drag`. Similar effect can be achieved by setting the position in `LV_EVENT_PRESSING`
- Add snapping
- Add snap stop to scroll max 1 snap point

### New layouts
- [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-grid/)-like layout support
- [CSS Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)-like layout support

### Styles
- Optimize and simplify styles
- State is saved in the object instead of the style property
- Object size and position can be set in styles too

### Events
- Allow adding multiple events to an object
- A `user_data` can be attached to the added events

### Driver changes
- `lv_disp_drv_t`, `lv_indev_drv_t`, `lv_fs_drv_t` needs to be `static`
- `...disp_buf...` is renamed to `draw_buf`. See an initialization example [here](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_sim_eclipse_sdl/blob/release/v8.0/main.c#L128-L141).
- No partial update if two screen sized buffers are set
- `disp_drv->full_refresh = 1` makes always the whole display redraw. 
- `hor_res` and `ver_res` need to be set in `disp_drv`
- `indev_read_cb` returns `void`. To indicate that there is more that to read set `data->continue_reading = 1` in the `read_cb`

### Other changes
- Remove the copy parameter from create functions
- Simplified File system interface API
- Use a more generic inheritance
- The built-in themes are reworked
- `lv_obj_align` now saved the alignment and realigns the object automatically but can't be used to align to other than the parent
- `lv_obj_align_to` can align to an object but doesn't save the alignment
- `lv_pct(x)` can be used to set the size and position in percentage
- There are many other changes in widgets that are not detailed here. Please refer to the documentation of the widgets.

### New release policy
- We will follow [Release branches with GitLab flow](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/gitlab_flow.html#release-branches-with-gitlab-flow)
- Minor releases are expected in every 3-4 month
- `master` will always contain the latest changes

### Migrating from v7 to v8
- First and foremost, create a new `lv_conf.h` based on `lv_conf_template.h`.
- To try the new version it's recommended to use a simulator project and see the examples.
- When migrating your project to v8
  - Update the drivers are described above
  - Update the styles
  - Update the events
  - Use the new layouts instead of `lv_cont` features
  - Use `lv_obj` instead of `lv_page`
  - The other parts are mainly minor renames and refactoring. See the functions' documentation for descriptions.
