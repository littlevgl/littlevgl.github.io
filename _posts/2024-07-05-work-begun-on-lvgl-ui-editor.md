In the past six months, we have been in discussions with both small and large companies to better understand their true needs. Based on these conversations, we have gained a solid understanding of the features that would significantly aid in developing and maintaining UIs:

:point_right: Adopting a XML or JSON based domain-specific language (DSL) to define the view UIs in a declarative way.
:point_right: Modular, easy-to-edit, and developer-friendly generated code for defining the logic.
:point_right: A component-oriented approach, similar to React on the web, along with robust component libraries to facilitate the creation of visually appealing projects even without a designer.
:point_right: Seamless integration with mainstream version control systems like Git, GitHub, GitLab, and BitBucket.
:point_right: A testing tool to detect regressions.
:point_right: Smooth transitions of UIs from Figma.

We have also gained significant partners who will assist us on this journey. We are finalizing the contracts now and hope to disclose their names next month.

While we believe we have a deep understanding of how this tool should work, we acknowledge that our view may not be perfect. Therefore, we will periodically publish beta versions during development to gather your feedback. We are targeting the summer of 2025 for the release of version 1.0.

According to our plans, it will be a closed-source commercial tool; however, it will be free for open-source projects.

Developing a UI editor is a significant step in LVGL’s evolution, and we are eager to hear your thoughts. Did we miss an important feature? Did we approach any aspect incorrectly? Please share your feedback and have a living discussion about LVGL’s UI editor.
