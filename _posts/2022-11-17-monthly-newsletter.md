**Bindings**
LVGL got a new [JavaScript](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_binding_js) binding which allows creating UIs in a React-ish style. Actually now we have some bindings that it's worth reviewing them:
- [MicroPython](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_micropython)
- [PikaScript](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_binding_pikascript)
- [Berry](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_binding_berry) with Tasmota support
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_binding_js)
- [C++](https://github.com/vpaeder/lvglpp) (on its way)
 
**RT-Thread competition**
The competition organized by RT-Thread and LVGL was completed. [Here](https://rt-thread.medium.com/embedded-gui-contest-winners-announcement-c719645d6331) you can check out the winners and get some inspiration. 
 
**New Xilinx port repo**
Thanks to [Pete Bone](https://github.com/pete-pjb) we just got a new port to [Xilinx Zedboard](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_xilinx_zedboard_vitis). It has a 2 core CPU with a VGA output. If you are into FPGAs I'm sure it's worth taking a look.

**New SquareLine blog post from Espressif**
Espressif has created a new demo with SquareLine Studio. Check it out here:

**Updated website**
We have updated [LVGL's website](https://lvgl.io) to make it cleaner and informative. What do you think?
 
**Driver development service**
We have established a partnership with [EDGEMTtech](https://www.edgemtech.com/). Now we are more confident with taking driver development projects too. So if you feel that you are not making the most out of your hardware and OS, just contact us!

**User projects**
- [100 MSps oscilloscope with RP2040 and LVGL](https://forum.lvgl.io/t/100-msps-oscilloscope-with-rp2040-and-lvgl-complete-documentation/10100)
- [ESP32 based thermal imaging camera with a LVGL GUI](https://forum.lvgl.io/t/tcam-an-esp32-based-thermal-imaging-camera-with-a-lvgl-gui/10193)

**Demos from NXP**
We have designed two demos for NXP and they implemented them in GUI Guider. Check them out here:
